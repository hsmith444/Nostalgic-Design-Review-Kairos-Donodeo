	<h4><p> <em>Nostalgic Design</em> Why this book?  Goes over her definition of nostalgia and why it’s important to have a positive connotation to nostalgia because it does have a reason for its being;  talks about the negative views of nostalgia and comments on how democrats typically eschew it to the conservative side, but we leave out populations who then become frustrated and not part of moving forward; she uses Trump’s rhetoric to coal miners in WV to show why it appealed but also uses another example from West VA where their nostalgia and pride in their ways allows for moving forward and innovation that is otherwise ignored.  She thinks it is important to explore why there is the nostalgia to further innovation or you remove groups from the conversation.  She also talks about rhetorical designers to reimagine English  majors as rhetorical designers because of the empathy with which we view populations and how this can impact design.
